This is a Jekyll Starter project, based on [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon), to get started quickly with setting up a blog using Jekyll on Github Pages. This bootstrap project includes social integration using [AddThis](https://www.addthis.com) for sharing and author following across many social media platforms. Integration with Google Analytics is also built in, using [Google Analytics superProxy](https://developers.google.com/analytics/solutions/google-analytics-super-proxy).

This project also includes tag visualization in each post, and as a consolidated tag based archive.

A grunt based build is included, which currently supports css minification and merging - for faster loading of the blog.
